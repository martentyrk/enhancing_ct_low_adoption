# Definition of dp_method:
#
# Throughout the code, the variable 'dp_method' is used to determine which
# method is used to make the covidscore differentially private.
#
# The specified options are:
#
# DP=-1, no DP applied;
# DP=2, uses the global sensitivity;
# DP=3, uses the private geometric mean of the FN scores after equilibration
#         (doesn't work well);
# DP=4, uses the multiplicative sensitivity per row of FN
#         (but doesn't work well);
# DP=5, corresponds to using log-normal on user for a day;
# DP=6, corresponds to DP on message only, Gaussian Mechanism
#         in the logit domain;
# DP=7, corresponds to using the Gaussian mechanism in log-domain when doing FN
#         (note that this method introduces a bias in the covidscore);

# Number of contacts to save per time window. Setting this value too small
# means that many contacts will be discarded (which implies that the predictions
# are worse and the peak infection rate could be worse)
